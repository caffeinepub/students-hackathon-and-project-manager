      "requirement": "Fix the deployment-blocking Motoko compilation issue in `backend/main.mo` by ensuring `isVerifier(caller : Principal) : Bool` reliably returns a `Bool` value (specifically the result of `AccessControl.isAdmin(accessControlState, caller)`) so the canister compiles and authorization checks behave as intended wherever `isVerifier` is used.",
      "reason": "No backend files were modified; there is no evidence that `isVerifier` was updated or that the referenced call sites were verified/adjusted to compile.",
